# Insulation-and-pressure-control-in-an-industrial-pipe
Both files are .m files. Use them in MATLAB or similar.

File Proyecto_Metodos is used to calculate the correct insulation for an industrial pipe. In this file the calculations are made in order to have a comparative between three different materials for the pipe and three different materials for the insulation. All the parameters are defined in the first lines of the code. Also, there are six different plots that show the combinations between the materials and the insulations. 

File Presion calculates the pressure drop by iterating. In this file the results are not plotted, since there is no interest in plotting them.
